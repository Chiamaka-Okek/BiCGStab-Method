**Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized method**
Biconjugate gradient stabilized method is an iterative solver that was developed by H.A. van der Vorst for solving numerical problems involving 
nonsymmetric linear systems. It is a variant of the biconjugate gradient method and the conjugate gradient sqaured. This method leads to a rather
faster and smoother convergence.


**Files included**
1. Bicgstab.hpp - consists of matrix class, operator overloadings and vector overloading
2. Bicgstab.cpp - implementations of the matrix class 
3. main.cpp - exploring the performance of hte linear solver


**Getting started**
This code can be compiled on your computer system using gnu c/cpp compiler.
